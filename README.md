# genesis-pride-flags

A SEGA Genesis ROM that hand-draws a gallery of pride flags, navigable via the left and
right directional buttons.

## Building & running

Assumes Linux.

```
./download_gendev.sh
./build.sh
```

This will output a new ROM file `out/rom.bin`.

## TODOs

- Missing the demisexual and intersex flags, because they require some slightly more
  complex drawing.
